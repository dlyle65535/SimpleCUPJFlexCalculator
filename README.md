SimpleCUPJFlexCalculator
========================

Demo program to show use of JFlex and CUP with Maven.

I couldn't find one demo with everything I needed in one place, so I made one. This is a Mavenized CUP (http://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/) "minimal" example. Worked out the JFlex plugin, CUP codegen using ant exec, addition of sources not managed directly by Maven and unit testing.

The "ant run" task can be executed using mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=Example.Parser -Dexec.args=input.test
